## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Express
Hosting: Render

I created three mock pokemons that anybody accors the world can access
I used express to handle the requests and the responses on my server-side code
I handled different possible request that the user could make
## Optimizations
Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory or on disk, reducing the need to fetch data repeatedly from the database or external APIs.

Minification and Compression: Minify your JavaScript and CSS files to reduce their size, and enable compression to reduce the size of responses sent over the network, improving load times.

Load Balancing: Deploy your API across multiple servers and use load balancing techniques to distribute incoming requests evenly, ensuring optimal performance and reliability, especially during periods of high traffic.
## Lessons Learned:

Technical Skills: Reflect on the new technical skills you acquired during the development of the API. For example, you might have improved your proficiency in JavaScript, Node.js, Express, or gained a better understanding of RESTful API design principles.

Problem-Solving: Discuss the challenges you encountered while building the API and how you overcame them. This could include debugging issues, resolving conflicts, or finding creative solutions to complex problems.

API Design: Share your insights into designing and implementing a user-friendly and intuitive API interface. Discuss the decisions you made regarding endpoint structure, request and response formats, and error handling strategies.
